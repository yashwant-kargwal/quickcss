            <h3>What is QuickCSS?</h3>
            <p>
                QuickCSS is a collection of utility-based CSS classes that make web design and development faster and more accessible. Instead of writing long custom CSS rules, QuickCSS allows developers to use pre-made classes that are easy to apply, making the development process quicker.
            </p>

            <h4>Why Should Developers Use QuickCSS?</h4>
            <p>
                QuickCSS reduces the need for repetitive code, making it easier to build layouts without getting bogged down by complicated CSS rules. It also helps create responsive designs with minimal effort, ensuring that your website looks great on any device.

                <li>Faster development time</li>
                <li>Customizable to fit any design needs</li>

                <li>Easy to integrate with existing projects</li>
            </ul>
